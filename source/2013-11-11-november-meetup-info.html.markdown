November's meeting will feature Michael Cochran (@vongrippen) speaking on Postgres and its newer datatypes including hstore and json.  There's still time for a second presenter to sign up!  It's a very rewarding experience and I highly recommend it.  We'll be meeting at [downtown at Coroutine HQ](http://goo.gl/maps/6620d) again and food will be provided by our hosts.

Presenters and attendees can [register on Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/memphis-technology-user-groups/events/146734512/).
