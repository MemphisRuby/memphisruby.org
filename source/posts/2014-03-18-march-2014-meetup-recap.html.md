We had another great [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/memphis-technology-user-groups/events/164701252/)
at [Coroutine](//coroutine.com) tonight! While the initial crowd was small, we
had more attendees trickle in for a pretty good turnout. We had pizza, some nice
conversation, and two presentations:

#### Taking an Application from Concept to Reality
[Daniel Soskel](//twitter.com/unstablereality) went over the development process
he used for his [parts store app](//ieeestore.herokuapp.com/). This was a Rails
application that he built for his senior project. He showed us how he determined
his database structure and data modeling, and finished with a nice demo.

#### Implementing Sidekiq Workers in Go
[Mike Cochran](//twitter.com/vongrippen) demonstrated a very interesting use
case for [Go](//golang.org). He replaced his resource intensive Ruby
[Sidekiq](////sidekiq.org/) workers with equivalent ones written in Go. Watching
these workers run highlighted how well Go's focus on concurrency and performance
can pay off.

Thanks to both of our presenters, and [Coroutine](//coroutine.com/) for the
pizza and meeting space. I am looking forward to the next meeting, where
[Daniel Pritchett](//dpritchett.net) will present about an unknown topic
related to [Spree Commerce](//spreecommerce.com/).
