Last night's meetup went off well - thanks Jessica and Daniel for presenting and thanks everyone for attending!

#### Presentations

- Jessica's slides are up for her [Scoped Invitations for User Group](http://slid.es/biggles/scoped-user-group-invitation-system-for-rails) presentation.  She's also [posted some of the code as a gist](https://gist.github.com/jlegosama/9026919).    

- Daniel had to improvise his gem presentation somewhat due to time constraints so there's no slideshow.  The gem itself is up on RubyGems for you to check out as [whateverman](http://rubygems.org/gems/whateverman).

#### MemphisRuby Library
We've just received our first publisher-donated books from Informit's [Professional Ruby](http://www.informit.com/promotions/addison-wesley-professional-ruby-series-135393) series.  Contact me if you'd like access to Eloquent Ruby, Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby (My personal favorite!), or Rails Tutorial.  I'll need to create a public spreadsheet for listing and tracking the library contents.  Volunteers welcome.

#### Housekeeping
Check out our __sweet__ new website!  Thanks [Keith Mattix](https://twitter.com/mystic77892) and [Josh Lewis](http://joshwlewis.com) for all your hard work.  Click the red github banner at the top of this page to submit your own enhancements or new blog posts.

Don't forget to sign up for the MemphisRuby mailing list!  You can also swing by #memphisruby on [freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net).  Links to these are at the bottom of the Memphis Ruby homepage.
