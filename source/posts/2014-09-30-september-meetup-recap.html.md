#### Unitwise
Our September [meetup](//www.meetup.com/memphis-technology-user-groups/events/204789062/) featured an extensive look at the gem [Unitwise](//github.com/joshwlewis/unitwise). Unitwise is a Ruby library for unit measurement conversion and math.

[Josh](http://www.joshwlewis.com), Unitwise creator and fellow Memphis Rubyist, walked us through Unitwise. For those who haven't needed such in-depth measurement conversion, myself included, he shared his initial use case for a unit conversion tool. Once everyone was on the same page, he moved to the core of the gem and all it's amazing capabilites. Josh loaded up a Ruby console and showed us the inner workings of Unitwise, while showing us the code behind it all. 

For me to try and explain all of Unitwise's true capabilites wouldn't give it justice. Josh has set up a [demo site](//unitwise.org/) that will let you see it in action. I recommend you check it out!
