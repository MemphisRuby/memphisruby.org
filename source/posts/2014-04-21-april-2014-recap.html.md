Last Tuesday's [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/memphis-technology-user-groups/events/169409982)
at [Coroutine](//coroutine.com) was another great one. We had two presentations:

#### Exploring Ruby's Enumerable and Comparable
I got us started with a quick demonstration on Ruby's Enumerable. I covered some
simple use cases of enumerable's methods, then finished it up with an example scenario
using Enumerable and Comparable as mixins. You can check out the
[slides](http://joshwlewis.com/slides/enumerable_comparable) and the
[sample code](//github.com/joshwlewis/game_of_enums).

#### Spree Commerce Tour
[Daniel Pritchett](http://dpritchett.net) gave us a great tour of [Spree
Commerce](//spreecommerce.com). It's a complete e-commerce solution built on
Ruby on Rails. He walked us through a demo site he had setup, where he
highlighted products, checkout, site administration, and hub integration.
